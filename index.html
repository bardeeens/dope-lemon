            DOPE LEMON is the dopest dope I've <strong>ever</strong> smoked! Here is the band biography:
        </h2>
        <p style="padding-right: 120px; padding-left: 120px;"> Dope Lemon is a performance pseudonym of Australian singer/songwriter Angus Stone, known to international audiences as half of the sibling indie pop duo Angus & Julia Stone. He also released material as part of Lady of the Sunshine and under his own name. Featuring a more electric, '90s slacker rock sound than on prior projects, Dope Lemon's first album grew out of writing at home on his farm and jamming with friends in his recording studio on the property. Prior collaborators Rohin Brown (the Walking Who) and Elliott Hammond (the Delta Riggs) are among those to appear on the finished debut, Honey Bones, which arrived on Universal in the spring of 2016. This was followed by the EP Hounds Tooth in early 2017, before Stone returned to working with his sister to record their fourth collaborative LP, Snow. The Dope Lemon project was revived in early 2019 with the single "Hey You," accompanied by the announcement of its second studio album, Smooth Big Cat, and an accompanying tour. With a more conceptual focus, the album focused around the Smooth Big Cat persona, described by Stone himself as "a mystical creature of leisure." The album, continuing in the beach rock sound of its predecessors, was released on BMG in the summer of 2019.</p>
